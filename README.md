# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of Mapping_Earthquakes

In this project, we are tasked with showing the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes around the world for the last seven days (as of February 21, 2022).  In order to accomplish this task, we pulled GeoJSON earthquake data from the [USGS website](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes), and retrieved geographical coordinates and earthquake magnitudes.  This data was then added to a map, so that the data could be visuallized at a glance. JavaScript and the D3.js library were used to pull the data into an interactive Mapbox map plotted through the Leaflet library.

## Resources

- Software: JavaScript 1.7, Mapbox v2.7.0, Leaflet 1.7.1
